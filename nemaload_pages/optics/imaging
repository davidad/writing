#Imaging

<p>Most generally, <b>imaging means measuring the continuous variations of a physical property over one or more spatial dimensions</b>, within some region. Like all measurements, images are imperfect (for example, they may be composed of pixels, each of which may be noisy), but there must be sufficient coherence between the image and the property to be masured that it provides some evidence therefor.</p>

<p>Imaging systems need not use imaging sensors. Radar, for example, is an imaging system that operates in the time domain. Many forms of medical imaging (including MRI, CT, and PET) employ a complex transformation that translates the data generated by the sensor into an image. In addition to sensors and algorithms, imaging systems may incorporate contrast agents (such as the radioactive isotopes used in PET), which translate the physical property of interest into one that is more readily measured, and/or actuators (such as the motor used in CT, or the magnetic resonator used in MRI), which modify the relationship of the sensor to the specimen in a way that creates information.</p>

<p><span class="nemaload">NEMALOAD</span>'s imaging system measures the physical property of neural activation, by way of intracellular calcium concentration, by way of the fluorescence of a <a href="/about/bio/geci">calcium-dependent fluorophore</a>. The fluorescence, in turn, is captured by an optical imaging system (a collection of lenses) which analyzes the <a href="/about/optics/light-field">light field</a> to produce a light field image on a camera sensor. Motion stages which translate the sample with respect to the optical elements could also be considered part of the imaging system, since they exist to make the optical measurements as informative as possible. Finally, algorithms translate the light field image into the final three-dimensional image of neural activation with respect to <a href="/about/eng/invariant-coordinates">invariant coordinates</a>.</p>
